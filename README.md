# face_recognition
Description

This project focuses on building a face recognition and identification system using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. The system captures images of individuals, processes them to detect faces, and trains a model to recognize and identify individuals based on their facial features.

Features

Image Capture: Captures 500 images of an individual from a webcam and saves them in a directory.
Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in the captured images.
Model Training: Trains a neural network model using the captured images.
Real-Time Face Recognition: Recognizes and identifies faces in real-time using a pre-trained model.
Probability Display: Displays the probability of the prediction along with the identified name.

Technologies Used

OpenCV: For video capture and face detection.

TensorFlow & Keras: For training and loading the neural network model.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

OS: For directory and file operations.

Accomplishments

Developed a complete pipeline for capturing images, detecting faces, and recognizing individuals.

Successfully integrated OpenCV for face detection and TensorFlow/Keras for model training and prediction.

Implemented real-time face recognition with high accuracy.
